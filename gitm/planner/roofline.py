For each op we compute:

    t_compute = flops / peak_flops_per_s

with a vendor-specific efficiency band ``(eff_lo, eff_hi)``: a kernel within
that band is "as expected". Residuals outside the band drive attribution.

The peak must match the op's dtype. A checkpoint that runs fp8 linears and
fp4 experts priced against a bf16 peak understates its own ceiling by 2-4x, and
an understated ceiling reads as recoverable headroom that isn't there — the one
error the headroom report exists to avoid making. ``roofline`` therefore resolves
a peak per dtype and records which peak it actually used, so a catalogue miss
surfaces as ``peak_is_fallback`` rather than as a confident wrong number.

    This is the term that makes MoE decode different from a dense FFN. Compute
    scales with the experts each token activates (``batch * top_k`` — linear),
    but an expert's weights are read from HBM **once** no matter how many tokens
    in the step route to it. So weight traffic scales with the size of the
    *union* of selected experts, which saturates:

        distinct(B) = E * (1 - (1 - k/E)^B)

    Under uniform routing, an expert is missed by one token with probability
    ``(1 - k/E)`` and by all ``B`` with that raised to ``B``. Two limits matter:

    * ``B * k << E`` -> ``distinct ~= B * k`` (linear; few collisions), and

      fetched the *whole* model and MoE's bandwidth advantage over a dense model
      of the same total size is gone).

    The knee sits near ``B ~= E / k``. Because compute keeps growing linearly
    past it while bytes flatten, arithmetic intensity rises with batch — which is
    why MoE decode is memory-bandwidth-bound at low batch and only becomes
    compute-bound at large batch.

    Uniform routing is an assumption, not a measurement. Real routers are skewed,
    and skew makes tokens *collide* on hot experts, so the true distinct count is
    at or below this estimate — the prediction errs toward more traffic (slower),
    never toward an optimistic floor. Deviation detection only needs a stable,
    directionally-correct reference, and the expert-imbalance invariant is what

    The planner predicts *per-rank* cost, because that is what a rank's kernels
    are observed doing. Two sharding modes exist for the experts and they are
    routinely conflated:

    * **TP-sharded experts** (``ep == 1``) — every rank holds a slice of *every*
      expert, cut along the intermediate dimension. Perfectly load-balanced, and
      the cross-rank cost is an all-reduce of hidden states.
    * **Expert parallel** (``ep > 1``) — every rank holds *whole* experts,
      ``n_routed_experts / ep`` of them, and tokens are shipped to whichever rank
      owns their expert. The cross-rank cost is an all-to-all.

    Both divide per-rank expert weight traffic by the same degree, so **EP versus
    TP is a collective trade, not a memory trade** — a distinction worth having in
    the graph, because the lever catalog would otherwise rank them as if one saved
    HBM traffic the other doesn't.

    ``ep_imbalance`` is where EP's real cost lives. Under TP every rank does
    exactly 1/tp of the work; under EP a step waits for whichever rank drew the
    most selected experts, and at low batch that skew is large. It defaults to
    1.0 (perfect balance) and is meant to be *calibrated from a trace* rather
